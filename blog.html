                        successful partnership with Garnier and L’Oréal! They have both been greatly generous to donate a
                        variety of items to support our staff on the Frontline at our Ottawa Hospitals! The products being
                        provided, such as micellar water, makeup and skin care products, are crucial to frontliners during
                        these circumstances and can surely help relieve the tensions of selfcare! The necessity of wearing
                        a mask for long periods of time can cause irritation and damage, so we are happy to help ease the
                        discomfort of all staff! Thank you once again to Garnier and L’Oréal!

                        deliver more PPE to help protect our workers on the frontline at this location, but we also provided them with
                        encouraging supplies! We are ever so grateful for our sponsors who have been immensely generous thus far! We were
                        able to relay products from Garnier and L’Oréal to help our frontliners with their selfcare. Also, we included
                        Red Bull energy drinks as well as nutritional bars from CLIF that we hope can give those working a boost of energy
                        and encouragement! We, at Frontline First, are very thankful to our donors, sponsors and, of course, our frontline
                        staff that is still working diligently to protect us every day! We look forward to future deliveries to the QCH!

                        This is important as our front liners are forced to over-sanitize their hands many times
                        each day, causing them to be extremely irritated and dry. Thanks to Clarins Canada
                        we can help relieve their discomfort during this hectic time.

                    <p class="mb-3"> Today, Frontline First partnered with Conquer COVID-19 in hosting their final
                        Ottawa PPE drive! Not only did we collect PPE which directly helps facilities across the city,
                        but we also collected a multitude of needed everyday items such as women’s hygiene products
                        (tampons, pads, and adult diapers) and infant products (diapers and baby wipes) which will be
                        donated back to our community. Our members, Alexa, Nadine, Emily and Tala, were able to
                        attend the drive to lend a hand to the Conquer COVID-19 team. We assisted with receiving items
                        at the drop off, securing inventory and preparing the donated articles for delivery, etc. Above all,
                        we had deeply significant conversations with members of Conquer COVID-19. When speaking to one of
                        the leaders, Reza Fakhraei, it was emphasized how important it is to come together as a society to
                        support those in need. Not only are our frontline workers extremely vulnerable in these circumstances,
                        but there are also several members of our community who find themselves less than fortunate. Ultimately,
                        we learned and settled today that individual efforts from donors, volunteers and contributors do
                        indeed sum up to a greater final result! Beneficence can truly never go unnoticed.
