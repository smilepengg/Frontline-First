                        how important social distancing is as the summer months approach. Our fight against COVID-19 is not over yet and our frontliners are
                        still working tirelessly day by day trying to protect us. In order to protect them, please remember to practice good social distancing & hygiene protocols!

                    <h2>PPE Drive - A Successful Collaboration with Conquer Covid-19</h2>
                    <p class="mb-3"> Today, Frontline First partnered with Conquer COVID-19 in hosting their final
                        Ottawa PPE drive! Not only did we collect PPE which directly helps facilities across the city,
                        but we also collected a multitude of needed everyday items such as women’s hygiene products
                        (tampons, pads, and adult diapers) and infant products (diapers and baby wipes) which will be
                        donated back to our community. Our members, Alexa, Nadine, Emily and Tala, were able to
                        attend the drive to lend a hand to the Conquer COVID-19 team. We assisted with receiving items
                        at the drop off, securing inventory and preparing the donated articles for delivery, etc. Above all,
                        we had deeply significant conversations with members of Conquer COVID-19. When speaking to one of
                        the leaders, Reza Fakhraei, it was emphasized how important it is to come together as a society to
                        support those in need. Not only are our frontline workers extremely vulnerable in these circumstances,
                        but there are also several members of our community who find themselves less than fortunate. Ultimately,
                        we learned and settled today that individual efforts from donors, volunteers and contributors do
                        indeed sum up to a greater final result! Beneficence can truly never go unnoticed.
